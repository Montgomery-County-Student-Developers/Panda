# Panda
A programming language that we're making in Python. It has C-like syntax, and should be easy for beginners to learn.
# Sample hello world:

    start {

        out("Hello, World!");
    
    }


# Sample program that outputs "Hello" 20 times:

    start {

        repeat 20 {
    
            out("Hello");
        
        };
    
    }
